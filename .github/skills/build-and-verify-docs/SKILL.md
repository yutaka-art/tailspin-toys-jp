description: Build, preview, and verify the Copilot Workshops Astro + Starlight workshop site before committing or opening a PR. Use whenever an author or agent is about to build the site, run a local preview/dev server, check links with lychee, confirm the page-count invariant, run the pre-commit verification sequence for any change under `docs/` (content) or `website/` (tooling), or make a PR-time consistency pass to catch structural drift (renamed paths, stale skill/instruction references, inaccurate CI claims, out-of-date structure trees).

# Build and verify the docs site

The workshop content is plain Markdown in the repo-root `docs/` directory; the Astro + Starlight site that publishes it lives in `website/` (sourcing content via the loader's `base: '../docs'`). This skill is the single source of truth for **how to build, preview, and verify** that site. The instruction files (`.github/instructions/*`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) describe *what content should look like*; this skill describes *how to run the tooling*.

Run every command from the **repo root** unless a step says otherwise.

## When to use

Trigger this skill whenever you:

- are about to build the site (`npm run build`) or start the dev server,
- need to preview content locally,
- are running the pre-commit / pre-PR verification pass on any change under `docs/` (content) or `website/` (tooling),
- want to confirm the page-count invariant or check links,
- are about to open or update a PR that touches `docs/` or `website/`.

For an optional **deeper, browser-based** pass that confirms pages actually render (console errors, broken images, mounted components), use the [`validate-site-playwright`](../validate-site-playwright/SKILL.md) skill after the static checks here.

## Local preview

The Astro dev server is the primary preview surface (hot reload):

```bash
cd website && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:4321/copilot-workshops/>. Lesson content lives in the repo-root `docs/` directory; the loader sources it via `base: '../docs'`, so no symlinks are required for preview.

## Verification sequence (run before every commit)

Run all three. Don't commit if any fails.

### 1. Build (clean)

```bash
cd website && rm -rf dist && npm run build
```

### 2. Page-count invariant

The workshop has 36 distinct route slugs. Starlight emits each route for the English root locale and the five configured localized routes, using English fallback content when a translation is unavailable. The built site therefore contains $36 \times 6 = 216$ workshop routes plus the one legacy redirect (`/shared/0-prereqs/`, authored as a full-HTML redirect page at `website/src/pages/shared/0-prereqs.astro`). The expected count is 217 `index.html` files when excluding the 404 page. Astro reports 218 HTML files because it includes the 404 page.

```bash
# distinct route slugs in the English root locale (docs/README.md + docs/<harness>/*.md)
find docs -maxdepth 2 -name '*.md' \
  ! -path 'docs/es-es/*' \
  ! -path 'docs/ja-jp/*' \
  ! -path 'docs/ko-kr/*' \
  ! -path 'docs/pt-br/*' \
  ! -path 'docs/zh-cn/*' | wc -l
# built pages (excludes the 404)
find website/dist -name index.html | grep -v 404 | wc -l
```

`built pages` should equal `(distinct route slugs × configured locales) + 1`. If the build emits **more** pages than that without a matching route or locale change, confirm localized content is directly under `docs/<locale>/` rather than an extra parent directory, then check the underscore-directory exclude in `website/src/content.config.ts`; it is still needed so support directories such as `_images/` are not routed as pages.

### 2b. Translations actually render (not silent English fallback)

The build and the page-count above are **blind to which content actually renders** — a mis-nested or wrongly-identified locale tree still emits 217 pages served from English fallback. Assert that a known translated page carries translated text and the right `lang` attribute:

```bash
grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>' website/dist/es-es/app/2-add-star-rating/index.html   # Spanish title
grep -o 'lang="[^"]*"' website/dist/es-es/app/2-add-star-rating/index.html | head -1  # lang="es-ES"
```

The Spanish title should read `Lección 2 - Ejecutar tu primera sesión de agente`, not the English string. Spot-check a second locale (e.g. `ja-jp` -> `lang="ja-JP"`).

### 3. Link check (lychee, offline)

The site builds with `base=/copilot-workshops/`, so internal hrefs are absolute (`/copilot-workshops/foo/`). Symlink that prefix to `website/dist` so lychee can follow internal links:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/lychee-root && ln -sfn "$PWD/website/dist" /tmp/lychee-root/copilot-workshops \
  && lychee --offline --no-progress --root-dir /tmp/lychee-root 'website/dist/**/*.html'
```

Lychee runs offline and won't catch broken **external** GitHub URLs. When you change absolute `https://github.com/...` links, click through them manually.

## What CI enforces vs. what is local-only

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs on PRs and on push to `main`. It runs **only**:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run build` (Astro build) — must succeed
3. lychee offline link check against `website/dist/` — must pass

After a push to `main`, `pages.yml` deploys `website/dist` to GitHub Pages. Browser validation and content-alignment analysis are separate optional/safety-net workflows, not part of the Pages build job.

## PR-time consistency pass

The build and link check above catch *mechanical* breakage. They do **not** catch *structural drift* — prose and reference material that silently falls out of sync when files move or conventions change. Before opening or updating a PR, make a consistency pass over everything your change touched:

- **Renamed or moved a file or folder?** Grep the whole repo for the old path and update every hit — `.md`, instruction files, skills, and the repository-structure trees in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `website/README.md`, `AUTHORING.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Example: when `images/` became `_images/`, every `../images/...` reference and every structure tree had to change.
- **Added or removed a skill, agent, instruction file, or workflow?** Grep for references to the old name and remove them. Add a new `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` file to the **Deeper conventions** list in `AUTHORING.md`, and to the structure block in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if it's structural.
- **Changed duplicated lesson prose?** Run the `check-content-alignment` skill to identify other inline copies that need the same update. The `.github/workflows/content-alignment.md` agentic workflow runs the same analysis on PRs as a safety net.
- **Described what CI does anywhere?** Confirm it matches `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which runs the build and the lychee link check.
- **Changed the build or verify steps?** This skill is the single source of truth. `README.md`, `AUTHORING.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` should *point here*, not re-document the commands. Keep any summary in those files consistent with this skill.
- **Repository-structure trees** in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `website/README.md`, `AUTHORING.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` should all reflect the real tree. If you add or rename a top-level content directory, update all of them.
- **Page-count invariant** (section 2 above) should still hold after the build.

When in doubt, `grep -rn "<old-name>" --include='*.md' .` (excluding `node_modules` and `website/dist`) is the fastest way to surface stale references.

## Quick reference

```bash
# from repo root
cd website && rm -rf dist && npm run build && cd ..
mkdir -p /tmp/lychee-root && ln -sfn "$PWD/website/dist" /tmp/lychee-root/copilot-workshops \
  && lychee --offline --no-progress --root-dir /tmp/lychee-root 'website/dist/**/*.html'
```
